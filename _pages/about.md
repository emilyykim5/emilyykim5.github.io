**Welcome!**

My name is Emily Kim, and I'm a sophomore at Harvard College studying computer science.


**Industry**

This past summer, I worked at [Regeneron](https://www.regeneron.com/) as a data science intern on the Digital Health Technologies team. Using Microsoft platforms like Excel, Power Automate, and Sharepoint, I streamlined workflows and designed data architecture for Regeneronâ€™s Clinical Outcomes Assessments and Digital Biomarkers technologies.


**Research**

Previously, I worked as a computational research intern at the [Stony Brook University Energy and Environmental Catalysis lab](https://sites.google.com/a/stonybrook.edu/tjkimgroup/people). I used computational kinetics profile modeling in Python to validate activated carbon's dual role as an adsorbent and photocatalyst, and my research was featured on the [World Economic Forum](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum_adding-dye-to-textiles-has-become-the-world-activity-7051977390280843265-OpKx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).


**At Harvard**

On campus, I serve as a board director on Harvard Computer Society's [Technology and Global Health Initiative (TGHI)](https://techglobalhealth.org/). TGHI hosts workshops and hackathons that explore the intersection of technology and healthcare. I also serve on the board for [Harvard WECode](https://www.wecodeconference.com/), which hosts the world's largest student-run conference for women in technology. In my free time, I enjoy going on walks along the Charles River and going to concerts with friends.
